## Context

Guinevere combines autonomous code execution, memory, surveillance integrations, network services, external APIs, and secrets. Defense-in-depth is required before production claims.

This ADR is part of the first Guinevere technical-core ADR batch and inherits these locked project decisions unless explicitly stated otherwise:

- Primary LLM is GPT-5.5 via 9Router with 1M context window.
- Sub-agent LLM is DeepSeek V4 Flash via 9Router.
- All LLM routing goes through 9Router; OpenRouter is not a fallback path.
- Memory uses PostgreSQL primary storage plus Redis cache; SQLite is excluded.
- Autonomous SDLC uses exactly 7 phases: Research; Plan & Delegate; Delegate; Execute; Validate & Audit; Update Documents; Setup Evidence.
- Guinevere MCP native fully replaces OpenCode/opencode for the project coding substrate.
- Prometheus + Grafana run on the primary VPS first.
- Wearable integrations are post-MVP and must not be treated as active dependencies.
- Browser automation uses obscura as primary and Playwright as fallback.

## Decision Drivers

- Canonical v2.0 documentation must remain internally consistent.
- Faiz is the sole owner and final approver; Guinevere may propose and execute but not silently change accepted decisions.
- Safety, consent, privacy, and recoverability outrank persona flavor and automation speed.
- The decision must be auditable through file-based evidence and linked source documents.
- Failure mode is high-impact because it can affect safety, secrets, intimate data, or system recovery.

## Considered Options

1. Rely on VPS firewall and private usage
2. Document security later
3. Create explicit defense-in-depth architecture

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: **Create explicit defense-in-depth architecture**.

Define a security architecture with network isolation, least privilege, service hardening, secret protection, audit logs, dependency scanning, webhook verification, prompt-injection defenses, and incident response hooks.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Reduces blast radius
- Connects infra security with model and data safety
- Supports future threat modeling

### Negative

- Requires more setup and ongoing review
- May constrain convenience integrations

### Risks

- Autonomous tools can become attack amplifiers
- Security docs must be implemented, not only written

## Implementation Notes

- Implementation must update the relevant v2.0 source documents or future superseding specs if this ADR changes state.
- Accepted ADRs must not be edited in-place for material decision changes; create a superseding ADR instead.
- Proposed ADRs require Faiz approval before they become binding runtime policy.
- Any sub-agent research, implementation summary, audit, or verification used for this ADR must be written to markdown evidence, not returned only inline.

## Review Record

- Reviewer: Guinevere Sub-Agent Reviewer
- Review Date: 2026-05-30
- Decision: Accepted with notes
- Notes: Accepted with notes: defense-in-depth coverage is solid and consistent with v2.0 architecture and API docs. Note to add explicit link to formal incident response playbook and threat-model update schedule.
